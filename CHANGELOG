v0.10.6
-------
Improve crash handling in import_with_file_system_metadata when the problem is a network burp.

v0.10.5
-------
Updated requirements.txt and install_requires to specify protobuf <= 3.19.4 when the python version is below 3.7.0 and
>= 3.19.0 when python version is above 3.7.0. protobuf dropped support for pythons lower than 3.7.0 when it released
version 3.20.0.

v0.10.4
-------
Rebuilt requirements.txt to fix encoding and contents.

Update the cli help entries for load_current_log_line to more closely match what is in the README.

Fixed a bug in Rivendell Audio Importer. There was a bug in the way it called subprocess.run due to back-porting
behind Python 3.7. Python 3.6 does not have the subprocess.run: capture_output param.

Added full instructions to the README file and this CHANGELOG.

v0.10.1
-------
Add requirements.txt and tests/requirements.txt

v0.10.0
-------
The initial public release of the wmul_rivendell python module.
