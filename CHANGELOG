v0.14.0
-------
Rework Rivendell Cart to be a Pydantic model.

Make the process of identifying out of bounds songs more straight-forward.

Add Adjusted Mean for the mean after the outliers and out-of-bounds songs are removed.

Make Zero the lower bound for outliers.

Rework Filter Cart Report and create Convert To Excel.

v0.13.0
-------
Extracted the logic for loading and initial filters of the Rivendell Cart Data Dump from FilterCartReportForMusicSchedule. That logic is now in LoadCartDataDump. This refactoring will allow DatabaseStatistics to re-use the code.

Add support for Python 3.12 and 3.13, remove support for Python 3.6 and 3.7

Change the way the trailing comma is added. Python 3.13 doesn't allow a comma to be included in the line terminator. Instead, a dummy additional field is added to the end of the record.

Remove the functionality for fixing the header bug from  3.6.4-3.6.6. It was a niche problem that is no longer relevant and fixing it creates other problems.

Add DatabaseStatistics for generating statistical information about the music database.

Add two additional failure checks to RivendellAudioImporter. One checks for a file with no group (in the root folder). The second checks to see if rdimport could not open the file.

v0.12.1
-------
BugFix on FilterCartReportForMusicScheduler
The new _remove_excluded_groups was not being called correctly.

v0.12.0
-------
RivendellAudioImporter: Catch crashes that occur when renaming a bad file and 
the file is locked by another user.

FilterCartReportForMusicScheduler: Add ability to exclude cuts by group name.

cli - load_current_log_line: Make the mail_username and mail_password optional, 
even when using the mail function.

v0.11.1
-------
Convert to pyproject.toml and publish to PyPI, vastly simplifying the 
installation process.

v0.11.0
-------
Added --fix_header to FilterCartReport to allow for a bug in Rivendell 3.6.4-3.6.6

v0.10.6
-------
Improve crash handling in import_with_file_system_metadata when the problem is a network burp.

v0.10.5
-------
Updated requirements.txt and install_requires to specify protobuf <= 3.19.4 when the python version is below 3.7.0 and
>= 3.19.0 when python version is above 3.7.0. protobuf dropped support for pythons lower than 3.7.0 when it released
version 3.20.0.

v0.10.4
-------
Rebuilt requirements.txt to fix encoding and contents.

Update the cli help entries for load_current_log_line to more closely match what is in the README.

Fixed a bug in Rivendell Audio Importer. There was a bug in the way it called subprocess.run due to back-porting
behind Python 3.7. Python 3.6 does not have the subprocess.run: capture_output param.

Added full instructions to the README file and this CHANGELOG.

v0.10.1
-------
Add requirements.txt and tests/requirements.txt

v0.10.0
-------
The initial public release of the wmul_rivendell python module.
