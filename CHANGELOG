v0.10.4
-------
Rebuilt requirements.txt to fix encoding and contents.

Update the cli help entries for load_current_log_line to more closely match what is in the README.

Fixed a bug in Rivendell Audio Importer. There was a bug in the way it called subprocess.run due to back-porting
behind Python 3.7. Python 3.6 does not have the subprocess.run: capture_output param.

Added full instructions to the README file and this CHANGELOG.

v0.10.1
-------
Add requirements.txt and tests/requirements.txt

v0.10.0
-------
The initial public release of the wmul_rivendell python module.
